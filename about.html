        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>When you can’t afford to make a mistake, I’m your man.</h2>

        <p>I am who I am, and so are you. I’m a longtime fan of beauty—and so are you. I’m the kind of person who can spot a typo from across the room. There’s a good chance you are too.</p>

        <p>The difference between a professional proofreader and a typo-spotter? The professional knows they’re correct. An amateur will think they’re correct—but not be able to explain why. I know. I was the same way.</p>

        <p>Have you ever heard of the Dunning-Kruger Effect? It’s a cognitive bias where people with low ability in a specific area overestimate their competence, while high performers tend to underestimate theirs. This happens because a lack of knowledge prevents people from recognizing their own limitations. Conversely, experts assume what’s easy for them must be easy for others.</p>

        <p>This year, I formalized my proofreading skills by taking classes, completing the assignments, building the resources, and passing tests in both general and transcript proofreading through ProofreadAnywhere.com. That’s in addition to a bachelor’s degree in business and economics, and years of experience in marketing and communications at a global pharmaceutical company, and recently at a global beauty company. I can do—and have done—all four levels of editing, but I’m focusing on proofreading for now.</p>

        <p>I’ve decided to devote what’s left of my life to helping others look and feel their best—visually and in writing. People perform better when their attire and written communication are polished. We're not all supermodels, and very few of us will win a Pulitzer Prize, but neither is required to be happy.</p>

        <p>My primary goal with this site is to help people strengthen their written communication.</p>

        <p><em>And soon, ColorMeToo.com will do the same for your personal style—helping you use color to create a flattering and coordinated visual presence.</em></p>

        <p>I make no apologies for being a Boomer. We don’t choose when we’re born. And yes, we made a mess of some things. But in our defense, we didn’t have Instagram or TikTok to show us the light. We did invent the technology platforms they live on, though. (Well, Hedy Lamarr invented the core idea in 1942—we just ran with it.)</p>

        <p>I'm on the younger end of the Boomer generation, so I’ll be around for a while.</p>

        <h3>Here’s what amateur proofreaders often don’t know:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>When a comma belongs—and when it doesn’t</li>
          <li>How to properly format footnotes, endnotes, and tables of contents</li>
          <li>Whether a book, movie, or TV title should be italicized or placed in quotes</li>
          <li>Why you shouldn’t use underlines unless you’re tabulating numbers</li>
          <li>Where the brain tricks us into skimming over errors</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Everyone—except maybe Jesus—suffers from Dunning-Kruger in some area of life. I want to work with people who know they’re not perfect, know their brains play tricks on them sometimes, and want to look their best in writing. It's not about snobbery or vanity—it's about survival.</p>
