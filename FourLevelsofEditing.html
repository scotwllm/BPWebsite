          Understanding what kind of editing you need can save time, money, and
          stress.
        </h3>

        <p>
          People often ask me to proofread their documents, and when I review
          them, it’s clear they’re not at the proofreading stage yet. Here’s a
          description of the four stages of editing.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve done all four throughout my career, and for smaller jobs, I can
          be flexible about who does what and how well it’s done. For larger
          jobs, I perform the higher-level editing at the average rate for that
          kind of work. For example, I won’t do developmental editing at a
          proofreader’s rate. When someone works outside their area of
          expertise, everybody loses: the client doesn’t get what they really
          need, and the service provider risks a bad reputation.
        </p>

        <p>
          I don’t want to tell a prospective client, “No, I won’t do that.”
          Instead, I explain the editing process and offer to find someone
          qualified to provide the editing services they need at each level.
          Hopefully, they remember that kindness and bring the job back to me
          when it’s at the proofreading stage.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are four common levels of editing (often called “editorial
          passes”). It’s important to understand these levels, because each
          requires a specific skill set, and editors charge different rates for each.
        </p>

        <h3>Level 1: Developmental Editing</h3>
        <p><em>(usually for book manuscripts)</em></p>
        <p>
          Sometimes called <em>structural</em> or <em>substantive</em> editing,
          developmental editing involves looking at the story as a
          <span class="nobr">whole—the</span> “big picture.” A developmental
          editor ensures that the story makes sense and that the author
          addresses larger issues before moving forward.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>plot</li>
          <li>setting</li>
          <li>overall structure</li>
          <li>character development</li>
          <li>addition, deletion, or rearrangement of scenes or content</li>
          <li>the introduction and ending</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Level 2: Line Editing</h3>
        <p>
          The line edit comes after the developmental edit is complete.
          Sometimes called <em>stylistic</em> or <em>content</em> editing, this
          stage drills down into more specific items.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>voice (word choice) and style (phrasing)</li>
          <li>refinement of characterization</li>
          <li>dialogue and dialogue tags</li>
          <li>hooks and prompts (chapter beginnings and endings)</li>
          <li>sentence structure</li>
          <li>coherence and concision within sentences</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Level 3: Copyediting</h3>
        <p>
          Copyediting is the stage most commonly confused with proofreading. I
          can’t stress enough that copyediting and proofreading are
          <strong>very</strong> different. When someone wants words changed or
          sentence structure fixed, that’s <strong>not</strong>
          <span class="nobr">proofreading—that’s</span> copyediting.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>grammar</li>
          <li>punctuation</li>
          <li>spelling</li>
          <li>fact-checking</li>
          <li>
            cross-checking the table of contents, footnotes, bibliography, etc.
            (if applicable)
          </li>
          <li>ensuring consistency of actions</li>
          <li>fixing “echo words” (repeated vocabulary)</li>
          <li>
            checking the accuracy of the timeline and sequencing of chapters and pages
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Level 4: Proofreading</h3>
        <p>
          You're almost there! It's time for final inspection. Proofreading originated with Johannes Gutenberg and his printing press. He would print one copy (a proof) for a client (the reader). Mass production started when both agreed the sample met the requirements of the job. Proofreading is the last stage before a piece of content goes live. A proofreader looks for issues that previous editorial passes may have missed or inadvertently added. This is <em>not</em> the stage for rewriting sentences or changing <span class="nobr">phrasing—but</span> if you see a glaring error, flag it for the author.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>typos</li>
          <li>double words (“the the,” “and and,” etc.)</li>
          <li>grammatical errors</li>
          <li>punctuation errors</li>
          <li>misspelled words</li>
          <li>formatting issues</li>
        </ul>
