      <p>You’ve got ideas. You’ve got hustle. Maybe even a great pitch.</p>
      <div class="bio-wrap">

      <p>But if your writing is riddled with errors, the people reviewing it—especially those my age—will spot them instantly, and they won’t be impressed. When we see sloppy writing, we don’t just see a typo; we see inattention to detail, a lack of polish, an inability to see patterns, a fear of asking for help—all signs that maybe you’re not ready for responsibility.</p>
        <p>I am who I am, and so are you. I’m a longtime fan of beauty — and so are you. I’m the kind of person who can spot a typo from across the room. There’s a good chance you are too.</p>

      <p>I’m a Boomer. That means I came up in a generation where grammar, spelling, punctuation, and clarity weren’t suggestions—they were mandatory.</p>
        <p>The difference between a professional proofreader and a typo-spotter? The professional knows they’re correct. An amateur will think they’re correct — but not be able to explain why. I know. I was the same way.</p>

      <p>And yes, we may overuse ellipses and double-space after periods like it’s 1982—but we’re working on it. Never forget that we created the platforms all this new-fangled technology is built on. We still approve hiring decisions and fund new ideas. <i>Get off my lawn!</i></p>
        <p>Have you ever heard of the Dunning-Kruger Effect? It’s a cognitive bias where people with low ability in a specific area overestimate their competence, while high performers tend to underestimate theirs. This happens because a lack of knowledge prevents people from recognizing their own limitations. Conversely, experts assume what’s easy for them must be easy for others.</p>

      <p>If your writing looks sloppy, Boomers notice. And they remember. What we’re not working on is our ability to spot a typo from across the room—that skill’s burned into our DNA.</p>
        <p>I decided to formalize my proofreading skills by taking classes, completing the assignments, building the resources, and passing tests in both general and transcript proofreading through ProofreadAnywhere.com. That’s in addition to a bachelor’s degree in business and economics, and years of experience in marketing and communications at a global pharmaceutical company. I can do — and have done — all four levels of editing, but I’m focusing on proofreading for now.</p>

      <p>But I’m not here to guard the gate—I’m here to help you cross the desert—especially if English isn’t your first language, and you’re already running a business, raising kids, and doing everything right—except sounding “right” to people like us.</p>
        <p>I’ve decided to devote what’s left of my life to helping others look and feel their best — visually and in writing. People perform better when their attire and written communication are polished. We're not all supermodels, and very few of us will win a Pulitzer Prize, but neither is required to be happy.</p>

      <p>You don’t have time to obsess over Oxford commas or worry whether “affect” or “effect” is correct in line four.</p>
        <p>My primary goal with this site is to help people strengthen their written communication.</p>

      <p>That’s my job. I’ll show you how to beat us at our own game—and sound like someone Boomers can’t ignore.</p>
        <p><em>And soon, ColorMeToo.com will do the same for your personal style — helping you use color to create a flattering and coordinated visual presence.</em></p>

      <h2>I Proofread to Pass the Test That Still Matters.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>proposals, pitch decks, and investor documents</li>
        <li>résumés, cover letters, and bios</li>
        <li>academic and business writing</li>
        <li>legal transcripts (verbatim and cleaned-up versions)</li>
        <li>web copy, blog posts, articles, and reports</li>
      </ul>
        <p>I make no apologies for being a Boomer. We don’t choose when we’re born. And yes, we made a mess of some things. But in our defense, we didn’t have Instagram or TikTok to show us the light. We did invent the technology platforms they live on, though. (Well, Hedy Lamarr invented the core idea in 1942 — we just ran with it.)</p>

      <p><strong>I also proofread court transcripts</strong>—where every word has to be accurate, and nothing can be assumed. That kind of work trains your eye (and your brain) to <em>never</em> skim over a mistake. And I bring that same rigor to everything I review.</p>
        <p>I'm on the younger end of the Boomer generation, so I’ll be around for a while.</p>

      <h2>Want to Be Taken Seriously? Start by Sounding Serious.</h2>
      <p>If your writing is clear, correct, and confident, you’ll be taken seriously—by anyone.<br />
      If it’s not, you’re giving them a reason to say no.</p>
        <h3>Here’s what amateur proofreaders often don’t know:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>When a comma belongs — and when it doesn’t</li>
          <li>How to properly format footnotes, endnotes, and tables of contents</li>
          <li>Whether a book, movie, or TV title should be italicized or placed in quotes</li>
          <li>Why you shouldn’t use underlines unless you’re tabulating numbers</li>
          <li>Where the brain tricks us into skimming over errors</li>
        </ul>
