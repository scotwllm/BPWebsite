      <p>You’ve got ideas. You’ve got hustle. Maybe even a great pitch.</p>
      <div class="bio-wrap">

      <p>But if your writing is riddled with errors, the people reviewing it—especially those my age—will spot them instantly, and they won’t be impressed. When we see sloppy writing, we don’t just see a typo; we see inattention to detail, a lack of polish, an inability to see patterns, a fear of asking for help—all signs that maybe you’re not ready for responsibility.</p>


      <p>I’m a Boomer. That means I came up in a generation where grammar, spelling, punctuation, and clarity weren’t suggestions—they were mandatory.</p>


      <p>And yes, we may overuse ellipses and double-space after periods like it’s 1982—but we’re working on it. Never forget that we created the platforms all this new-fangled technology is built on. We still approve hiring decisions and fund new ideas. <i>Get off my lawn!</i></p>
        

      <p>If your writing looks sloppy, Boomers notice. And they remember. What we’re not working on is our ability to spot a typo from across the room—that skill’s burned into our DNA.</p>
      

      <p>But I’m not here to guard the gate—I’m here to help you cross the desert—especially if English isn’t your first language, and you’re already running a business, raising kids, and doing everything right—except sounding “right” to people like us.</p>
        <p>I’ve decided to devote what’s left of my life to helping others look and feel their best — visually and in writing. People perform better when their attire and written communication are polished. We're not all supermodels, and very few of us will win a Pulitzer Prize, but neither is required to be happy.</p>

      <p>You don’t have time to obsess over Oxford commas or worry whether “affect” or “effect” is correct in line four.</p>
    

      <p>That’s my job. I’ll show you how to beat us at our own game—and sound like someone Boomers can’t ignore.</p>


      <h2>I Proofread to Pass the Test That Still Matters.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>proposals, pitch decks, and investor documents</li>
        <li>résumés, cover letters, and bios</li>
        <li>academic and business writing</li>
        <li>legal transcripts (verbatim and cleaned-up versions)</li>
        <li>web copy, blog posts, articles, and reports</li>
      </ul>
 

      <p><strong>I also proofread court transcripts</strong>—where every word has to be accurate, and nothing can be assumed. That kind of work trains your eye (and your brain) to <em>never</em> skim over a mistake. And I bring that same rigor to everything I review.</p>


      <h2>Want to Be Taken Seriously? Start by Sounding Serious.</h2>
      <p>If your writing is clear, correct, and confident, you’ll be taken seriously—by anyone.<br />
      If it’s not, you’re giving them a reason to say no.</p>
