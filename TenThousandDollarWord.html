      <p>A few years ago, I was having drinks with an HR director—the kind of person who reads résumés for sport—and she told me about what she calls “$10,000 words.”</p>

      <p>“What’s a $10,000 word?” I asked.</p>

      <p>“They’re the mistakes that cost applicants real money,” she said. “If I see spelling or grammar errors in a résumé, the salary offer drops. Sometimes by ten grand.”</p>

      <p>She wasn’t talking about protected characteristics—age, race, gender—but the qualities that actually matter to employers: attention to detail, communication, and pattern recognition.</p>

      <p>“Pattern recognition?” I asked.</p>

      <p>She said, “If someone doesn’t notice that sometimes a word is spelled <em>your</em>, sometimes <em>you’re</em>, and sometimes <em>yore</em>, that tells me two things. Either they have poor pattern-recognition skills, or they’re too lazy to figure out why the word changes. And neither of those qualities are good for business.”</p>

      <p>That was the moment I understood that grammar isn’t just about correctness—it’s about perception. A misplaced comma might not ruin your career, but it can nudge a hiring manager’s confidence in your professionalism. Details tell <span class="nobr">stories—and</span> employers are listening.</p>

      <p><em>Full disclosure:</em> that story’s made up. HR people don’t get drunk* with employees. But the moral holds—if your writing looks sloppy, it’s not just your spelling that takes the hit.</p>
<p>*She had half a glass of wine.</p>
