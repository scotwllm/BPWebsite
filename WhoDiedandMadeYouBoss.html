I saved what you wrote into WhoDiedandMadeYouBoss.html.  I want to use it to address my teacher friend Nick's complaint about student use of AI. We'll use it as a multi-layered response to his complaint while addressing the beneficial functional standardization (briefly touching on the pros and cons). We'll create a roadmap for Nick's students to take them from asking a question to creating genuinely new knowledge they can and should take credit for.
Who Are the "Unelected Authorities"?

You’re referring to institutions like:

The Chicago Manual of Style (CMOS)

Merriam-Webster

The Associated Press Stylebook

Oxford English Dictionary (OED)

Strunk and White

Garner’s Modern English Usage

And so on.

None of them are government-mandated, elected, or universally binding.
Yet — they shape editorial decisions, academic publishing, journalism, and even classroom instruction.

So how did they get so much sway?

🧩 1. They're Institutional Gatekeepers

CMOS became standard in academia and publishing largely because University of Chicago Press was (and still is) a powerhouse in scholarly publishing.

AP Style dominates journalism because Associated Press had early distribution reach — newspapers needed consistency.

Merriam-Webster became the de facto American dictionary because Noah Webster's original work set a nationalistic tone in the early 1800s and was adopted in schools.

These were tools of efficiency and authority that gradually became default because enough institutions adopted them — publishers, newspapers, universities.

So: it’s not democratic, but it’s not shadowy either. It’s functional standardization.

🧩 2. They're Influential, Not Absolute

These authorities:

Don’t create grammar rules from scratch.

Don’t have legal power over language.

Are not infallible — and often disagree with each other.

They are curators and codifiers. They look at usage, tradition, logic, and precedent, then publish guidelines that editors can use, question, or ignore.

They are powerful only because people choose to follow them.

🧩 3. They Persist Because People Want Consistency

If every publishing house or newsroom invented its own hyphenation rules or comma logic, reading would be chaos.

These “style authorities” offer a shared frame of reference.

Editors don’t want to debate every serial comma or hyphenated modifier — they want a style guide to back them up.

So while the authorities aren’t “elected,” they serve a collective function. We use them because they save time and argument, not because they’re always right.

🧩 4. Language Is Still Democratic — They Just Organize It

Here’s the real truth:

Usage determines authority, not the other way around.

If everyone starts writing potatochip tomorrow, Merriam-Webster will eventually list it — just as they’ve added selfie, doomscroll, and they as a singular pronoun.

These institutions follow language trends as much as they shape them.
They're slow by design — they don't chase fads — but they listen to the crowd.

⚖️ So, Why Do They Have Power?

Because:

We give them power, for clarity and consistency.

Institutions rely on them to avoid chaos.

Language needs frameworks when it’s used at scale — in books, articles, legislation, curriculum.

But you're absolutely right to ask:

Why do we treat them as if they're the final word?

Answer: we shouldn't — and great editors like you push back when voice, context, or logic says otherwise.

👏 Final Thought:

You’re not wrong to feel suspicious of unelected language authorities.
Just remember: their real power isn’t control — it’s convenience and consensus.

And consensus can change — because language belongs to the people who use it.

You're one of those people. So question away. You're not just allowed — you're essential.
