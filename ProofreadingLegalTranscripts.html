      <p><strong>A legal transcript proofreader’s primary tool is punctuation.</strong> It’s how we turn a word salad into a meal.</p>

      <p>Proofreading legal transcripts isn’t like cleaning up a report or polishing web copy. It’s a balancing act between clarity and fidelity—making sense of what was said without changing what was meant. You’re not the author; you’re the witness to the witnesses.</p>

      <p>In most writing, a proofreader looks for flow, tone, and readability. In transcripts, you’re listening for accuracy—not just in the words, but in how they land. Every comma, dash, and ellipsis has a job: to capture hesitation, interruption, or emotion. It’s the difference between “I didn’t <em>say</em> he stole the money” and “I didn’t say he <em>stole</em> the money.” Same words. Different meaning. Punctuation is the record of intent.</p>

      <p>It’s the same exercise acting coaches love—shifting the emphasis in a line to change its meaning entirely. Try it with “I didn’t order the anal probe.” (The guys at <em>South Park</em> built an empire on that one.)</p>

      <p>Unlike in traditional editing, you can’t smooth over awkward phrasing, fix grammar, or “improve” a speaker’s word choice. You can’t decide that “gonna” should become “going to.” You document it exactly as it was said—even when it makes you wince.</p>

      <p>Legal transcript proofreaders live in a constant state of tension: we crave clean writing, but our job is to protect messy truth. Our success is invisible—no one notices the commas that prevent confusion or the dashes that capture a witness’s breath. But when it’s done right, accuracy reads effortlessly.</p>
